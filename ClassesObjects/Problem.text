                   Project Based - LMS - 6

In this task, you will build a simple console-based program that simulates a basic Learning Management System (LMS) functionality involving both students and trainers.


1. Student Module:
     1) Student Class: This class represents a student with attributes like ID, name,  attendance, performance scores and trainer ratings. It includes methods for calculating attendance credits, performance credits, and determining the student’s achievement status.
     2) Collect and display the Student ID and Name.
     3) prompt for the number of sessions attended by the student.
        Accept a score and calculate:
        Attendance credits based on the number of sessions attended:
            30 or more: +5 credits
            20–29: +3 credits
            Below 20: 0 credits
        Performance credits based on the score:
            85 or more: +5 credits
            60–84: +3 credits
            Below 60: 0 credits
     4) Compute final achievement based on total credits: 
            10 or more → GOLD
            8–9 → SILVER
            Below 8 → "You Need To IMPROVE"

2. Trainer Module:

      1) Trainer Class: This class represents a trainer with attributes like ID, name, and sessions taken. 
         It calculates the trainer’s payment based on sessions and a potential bonus that is determined by the student’s rating.
      2) Collect and display the Trainer ID and Name.
      3) Ask for the number of sessions taken by the trainer.
      4) Calculate session-based payment (₹1500 per session).
      5) Prompt for student's rating for the trainer (1 to 5):
            If rating is 5 → add bonus of ₹5000
            Otherwise → no bonus
            Display total trainer payment (session payment + bonus)


    LMSGradePaymentTracker (Main Class): This is the main class where we instantiate objects of Student and Trainer, set some initial values, 
and use the methods from each class to perform calculations and display information.
